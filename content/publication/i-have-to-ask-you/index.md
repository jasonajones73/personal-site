abstract = "Apparently ELGL co-founder Kent Wyatt moonlights as a private background investigator, diving deep into the past lives of all of his ELGL family. Sometimes I forget that I spent five years as a track and field athlete while also receiving a quality education at North Carolina State University. I mean, it isn’t really something that you whip out of your “fun facts bag” all that frequently. Discussing the intricate physics of spinning in a circle with a sixteen pound cast iron ball before releasing it in a blur of chalk dust and grunting doesn’t make for the best dinner conversation."
